# 📁 .github Directory

This `.github` directory contains our **Default community health files** for the Numerimondes organization and clients.  
It includes all shared files and resources used for managing **visual identity**, **branding**, and **media assets** exclusively across Numerimondes’ GitHub projects, clients, and affiliated brands.

---

## 📂 Main Structure

- **assets/**  
  The root folder containing all assets for Numerimondes and its ecosystem, organized into four main subfolders:

  - **brands/**  
    Contains brand-specific resources for Numerimondes and affiliated brands such as:  
    - `numerimondes/`  
    - `thebestrecruit/`  
    - Other affiliated or owned brands  
    This includes logos (multiple versions and sources), banners, official documents, team media (photos, bios), and more.

  - **clients/**  
    Contains visual identity, marketing, media, and deliverables specific to our clients (examples: `la-cafe-litteraire-de-fes`, `numerimondes`).  
    This folder also contains operational scripts such as:  
    - `create-client.sh`  
    Typical folder organization inside clients:  
    - `identity/` → Logos, fonts, colors, brand guidelines  
    - `marketing/` → Banners, visuals  
    - `media/` → Videos, audios  
    - `team/` → Team members (photos, roles)  
    - `deliverables/` → Final exports  
    - `resources/` → Templates and auxiliary documents  
    - `other-assets/` → Miscellaneous items  

  - **commons/**  
    Contains generic, reusable resources shared across all Numerimondes brands, clients, and projects:  
    - `config/` → e.g., `countries.txt`  
    - `fonts/` → Font files such as `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`  
    - `icons/`, `media/`, `scripts/`, `templates/` → For emails, HTML, PDF, and other uses.

  - **projects/**  
    Contains graphic and media assets specific to certain projects such as `nadim` or `webkernel`:  
    - Logos, illustrations, thumbnails  
    - Source files such as SVGs stored in `sources/` subfolders  

---

## 📘 Conventions

- Source files are generally stored within `sources/` subfolders.  
- Media assets are versioned (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) to allow evolution and backward compatibility.  
- Branding resources follow the DRY principle: all reusable items are centralized in `commons/`.  

---

## 👥 Contribution Guidelines

To add or update resources, contributors should:  
1. Use the correct subfolders (`v1`, `sources`, `preview`, etc.).  
2. Document changes or additions inside local `README.md` files when present (especially for clients).  
3. When adding new clients or projects, maintain folder structure consistency by following existing examples.
